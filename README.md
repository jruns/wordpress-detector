# wordpress-detector
A simple browser extension notifying of a WordPress site in your current tab.

## Location installation instructions
Coming soon

## ToDo
1. Correctly set the toolbar icon when multiple windows are open and focus switches between them.
2. Find WordPress sites that miss the head check (like sites using a CDN), and add body checks to match those as well.
